React native basic lectures 

If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. If you'd like to try out React Native directly in your web browser before installing any tools, you can try out Snack.

If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

Assuming that you have Node 10 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```bash
$npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then run the following commands to run this React Native project called "rn-complete-guide":

```bash
$cd rn-complete-guide
$npm start # you can also use: expo start
```

This will start a development server for you.
